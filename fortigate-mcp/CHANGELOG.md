# Changelog

All notable changes to fortigate-mcp will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.1] - 2026-11-09

### Changed

- Dependencies only move to releases that are at least 7 days old. pydantic 2.14.3 → 2.14.2,
  pydantic-core 2.50.4 → 2.50.2 and typing-inspection 0.4.5 → 0.4.4 went back to the newest
  releases that meet this; the newer ones follow once they are old enough.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-11-05

First versioned release.

### Added

- Read tools for a FortiGate (policies with hit counters, objects, VIPs, interfaces, routing, VPN, HA, health) and opt-in writes for address objects, groups and policy state.

### Changed

- Moved to MCP SDK 2.x (`MCPServer`). Tools, parameters and env vars are unchanged; the server now
  reports its own version as `serverInfo.version`. `FASTMCP_HOST` is no longer read: the HTTP daemon
  binds to `MCP_HOST`.
- All dependencies updated; Docker images use Poetry 2.5.1.

### Security

- pyjwt 2.15.1, anyio 4.16.0, cryptography 50.0.2 (CVE-2026-69247) and certifi 2026.10.23 fix the
  advisories pip-audit reported for the earlier locks.
